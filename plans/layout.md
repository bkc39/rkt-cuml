# rkt-cuml layout: the owner's decisions so far

1. **A multi-package repository, typed-racket style.** Every package uses
   `(define collection 'multi)` and adds modules to the one `cuml/`
   collection:

   | Package | Holds | deps |
   |---|---|---|
   | `cuml-core-lib` | `cuml/core`: shared infrastructure for the family packages | base, raft |
   | `cuml-<family>-lib` | `cuml/<family>` and its shim loader, e.g. `cuml-cluster-lib` | base, raft, cuml-core-lib |
   | `cuml-lib` | `cuml/main.rkt`, re-exporting `cuml/core` and every family | the -lib packages |
   | `cuml-doc` | the one manual, `cuml/scribblings/cuml.scrbl` | cuml-lib + doc build deps |
   | `cuml-test` | every test, `cuml/tests/...` | everything |
   | `cuml` | meta package | cuml-lib, cuml-doc |

   A family package never depends on `cuml-lib` or on another family, so
   requiring `cuml/cluster` loads no other family's native library.

2. **Family packages export algorithm-specific procedures** (`kmeans-fit`,
   `kmeans-predict`, `dbscan-fit`, ...) that wrap libcuml. They never export
   a bare algorithm name (`kmeans`, `dbscan`, ...): those are reserved for
   the estimator wrappers in `cuml-lib`, so `cuml/main` re-exports everything
   without a collision.

3. **A scikit-learn-like estimator interface** (`define-generics`: `fit`,
   `predict`, ...) with wrappers in `cuml-lib`. Open:
   - whether the generics themselves live in `cuml-core-lib` (recommended,
     so glmnet and other libraries can implement them);
   - functional fit: `fit` returns a fitted estimator rather than mutating;
   - small capability generics (`fit`, `predict`, `transform`, ...) with a
     `fit-predict` fallback built from them.

4. **The opaque model-handle helper** (a native object plus its finalizer,
   keeping its resources alive) lives in `cuml-core-lib`.

5. **Scope: clustering only for now** (k-means, DBSCAN, single-linkage
   agglomerative, spectral, HDBSCAN). None needs sparse arrays. HDBSCAN's
   outputs sized by the call use raft's deposit records (rkt-raft #22,
   merged).

6. **cuML is GPU-only.** libcuml has no CPU path, so neither has cuml.
